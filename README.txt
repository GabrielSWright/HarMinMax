README for HarMinMax

HarMinMax contains the codon usage frequency tables for 5 species Mus musculus (mouse), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Homo sapiens (human), and Escherichia  coli. Codon usage tables for other species can be taken from HIVE-CUT and imported manually into the code. 

To use the code, simple paste the nucleotide sequence of interest into line 3, then select the species in lines 1 and 2, then run the script. The code will save a %MinMax plot to the working directory showing the harmonized and target curves. 

Updated/cleaned/more user friendly code will come in the future.
